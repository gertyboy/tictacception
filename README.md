# tictacception

Rules of the game:

X moves first
O moves next
First move you may go anywhere you want
Every following move must be made in the corresponding box (eg. if I clicked the top left square of a tic tac toe game the next play m bugust be in the top left game)
If the corresponding box has already been won then you may go wherever you wish.

If you find any bugs please report them so I can fix it.
Suggestions are also welcome.
